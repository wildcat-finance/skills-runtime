"""The whole preservation-release path, offline, from the repository root.

    python3 plugins/lazarus/examples/preservation-release-demo.py

Verifies the checked-in Goldfinch fixture, captures an Ariadne statement over it,
writes a release, reads that release back, and reads the shipped release back
too. Then the two refusals that matter, because a path that only succeeds
demonstrates nothing:

1. A manifest with one integer edited and its fixture digest recomputed, so the
   document is entirely self-consistent. Lazarus recomputes the three evidence
   counts from the records and refuses it. Ariadne reads the counts from the
   manifest and does not re-derive them, so it accepts the same fixture and
   writes a statement reporting six proof-backed records where two exist.
2. An honest fixture with a statement that overstates it. This is the one the
   release path exists for: the binding holds a statement to what verification
   recomputed rather than to what the manifest claims, and names the class and
   both numbers.

Needs no network and no provider. Writes only into a temporary directory and
leaves the checked-in fixture and release untouched.

The capture step runs Ariadne, which lives in this repository beside Lazarus. A
release does not need it: reading one back is Lazarus alone, and the shipped
release is read back here without Ariadne being involved.
