# Ethereum USDC interval collector, v0

<!-- marketplace-context:start -->
> **Marketplace context: Alexandria.** Alexandria preserves heterogeneous lending data as digest-bound releases, then derives only the credit views a reviewed mapping can defend. Use Tabularium when the job is semantic event mapping, Probitas when the deliverable is a counterparty dossier, and Lazarus when a test needs finite historical state or exact RPC replay. **Current frontier:** A resumable Ethereum USDC interval collector now shards, reconciles and verifies offline; it has never run against a live provider, reads no start block and preserves no implementation code.
<!-- marketplace-context:end -->

The whole collector, end to end, with no network:

```bash
python3 plugins/alexandria/examples/usdc-interval-v0/demo.py build --output <directory>
python3 plugins/alexandria/examples/usdc-interval-v0/demo.py verify <directory>
```

`build` collects the fixture interval in bounded shards, is killed once
mid-shard and resumed, reconciles the finished interval against the second
fixture provider, builds the Alexandria release and verifies it. `verify`
re-derives the release identifier from the built release and compares it, and
the recorded summary, with `expected.json`.

## What it produces

Five shards of twenty blocks over the Ethereum USDC Comet's declared interval,
one implementation epoch covering all of it, an agreement between the two
providers, and release
`sha256:d286ba9f58a2ed6689957a763dfbd45decf54b3b6391db5aff37cf25dcfaa11d`. Two
builds of the same fixtures agree byte for byte.

## What it does not establish

The fixtures are synthetic. Block hashes, transaction hashes, log payloads and
the implementation code read are derived from fixed strings and were
not observed on any chain. Only the proxy address, the EIP-1967 implementation
slot and the `Upgraded(address)` topic are the real ones. Both paths run with
no network: neither opens a socket, and a test asserts it.

So this demonstrates the collector's behaviour, not a preserved Compound v3
record. It establishes no publisher identity, no provider completeness, no
consensus finality and no canonical-chain membership, and it derives no credit
event: the release's own coverage says all of that in its gaps.

## Files

- `demo.py` is the whole path, `build` and `verify`.
- `fixtures/primary.json` holds the first provider's synthetic chain state and
  the interval plan it answers for.
- `fixtures/secondary.json` names the second provider's class; it agrees with
  the first everywhere, and the tests cover what a disagreement does.
- `fixtures/epochs.json` holds the epoch evidence `build` consumes: one slot
  read, one code read and two block hashes.
- `expected.json` pins what the path produces.
