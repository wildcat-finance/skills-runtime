///      and is never resolved. A target with no `.` is its own symbol.
///      Storage scope `hook` resolves the symbol `hook` and scope `host` the

///      the symbol prefix of its slot string.
///
///      The grammar stops there. A value movement's `asset` and `recipient`
///      carry no suffix in the schema, so their whole string is the name and
///      the dot is part of it: `USDC.e` is the bridged token, not `USDC`.
///
///      That reading also constrains the two paths the grammar does apply to.
///      A dot is an ordinary character in an account name, so `USDC.e` as a
///      call target or an external slot would bind the permit to `USDC` --
///      the same substitution, on the paths that split. The reader cannot
///      tell a suffix from a dotted name by looking, so it asks the adapter
///      about every other reading the string has -- one per dot after the
///      grammar's own, and the whole string last. If the adapter knows any of
///      them the manifest is ambiguous and the reader refuses rather than
///      choosing a prefix the author may not have meant. Asking only about
///      the whole string is not enough: `USDC.e.transfer` is a dotted account
///      carrying an ordinary function suffix, and its live reading is the
///      intermediate one. A real suffix is not a name an adapter holds, so
///      `roleProvider.getCredential` is unaffected.
///
///      Staticcall reading: a `staticcall` kind entry never admits a
///      state-changing call to its target. Only kinds `call` and
///      `delegatecall` enter the state-changing allowed set; gate 1 never
///      treats a read as an effect, and letting a staticcall entry admit
///      state-changing calls would widen the permit beyond what the manifest
///      said. Every entry's symbol, staticcall included, must still resolve,
///      so a misnamed entry aborts instead of vanishing.
///
///      Fail-closed posture: an action the manifest does not carry, a
///      duplicated action name, a symbol the adapter cannot resolve, a blank
///      account symbol, and a resolution to the zero address each revert with
///      a named error. The reader never returns a default or shrunken set,
///      and never admits an entry the manifest did not write.
///
///      Blank means empty or nothing but ASCII whitespace. Both arise the
///      same way, from a target or slot the grammar cannot take a name out
///      of -- `.getCredential`, or ` .field` -- and neither is a name the
///      manifest author wrote. Asking the adapter about one would make
///      failing closed the adapter's decision rather than the reader's,
///      which is what this guard exists to prevent.
///
///      Granularity boundary, stated because the header would otherwise read
///      stricter than the reader is: resolution is account-granular. A slot
///      expression such as `lenderStatus[lender]` contributes only its
///      account, and a target's function suffix contributes only its account,
///      so a permit the manifest wrote at slot or function granularity is
///      enforced at whole-account granularity. Gate 1 compares accounts and
///      never `StorageWriteObs.slot`, which is the stated non-goal this
///      matches. Call *kind* is the one dimension that is carried through,
///      because `call` and `delegatecall` differ in whose storage changes.

  ///      `UnresolvableSymbol` and `SymbolResolvesToZero` and report the
  ///      second reading of a name whose first reading was already broken.
  ///
  ///      And the question is `ok` alone, not `ok` with a non-zero address.
  ///      A known name resolving to zero is a refusal this reader raises --
  ///      `SymbolResolvesToZero` exists for exactly that answer -- not an
  ///      absence it may read as "no second reading". Treating it as an
  ///      absence left the whole of S2-R3-01 alive in that corner: with an

  ///      for `USDC.e`, the value path refused the manifest and these two
  ///      paths bound the permit to 0xC0 -- one string, one resolver, two
  ///      different accounts, which is the defect the guard was added for.
  ///
  ///      The third detail is which names are asked about, and it is where the
  ///      question was drawn too narrowly again. A written name does not have
  ///      two readings; it has one per dot, plus the whole string. Asking only
  ///      about the whole string closes the guard on a name the adapter is
  ///      unlikely to hold and leaves it open on the shape this manifest
  ///      actually writes: every dotted target here is `account.function`, so
  ///      a dotted *account* written with its function suffix is
  ///      `account.part.function`, and the reading the author meant is the
  ///      intermediate one. With `USDC` at 0xC0 and `USDC.e` at 0xCE,
  ///      `USDC.e` refused and `USDC.e.transfer` bound the permit to 0xC0 --
  ///      the bridged token the manifest named unpermitted, and one it never
