  ///      GL10 fires from `_anyAmbiguous`, a flag the *generator* sets because
  ///      it knows in advance which names it considers ambiguous, so GL10 goes
  ///      blind exactly when the generator's idea of ambiguity drifts from the
  ///      reader's -- which is the blind spot S2-R5-01 was found in. GL11
  ///      needs no such oracle: it compares the reader against itself, so it
  ///      still fires on a name nobody remembered to declare.
  ///
  ///      Its reach is stated rather than assumed. It sees only the case where
  ///      two paths both bind, so it kills the guard-deleted mutant and does
  ///      not kill S2-R5-01, whose call path binds while the value path
  ///      refuses. GL10 is what covers that direction, and neither property
  ///      stands in for the other.
  ///
  ///      One of the three comparisons below cannot fire today, and it is
  ///      recorded rather than left implying cover it does not give. The call
  ///      and slot arms resolve the same written name through the same
  ///      `_resolveDotted` grammar, differing only in which manifest field
  ///      carries it, so `slotBound` always equals `callBound` and any single
  ///      defect that moves the slot arm moves the call arm with it -- the
  ///      call/value comparison reaches it first. Deleting the slot/value line
  ///      therefore changes no result here, which was confirmed by mutation
  ///      rather than assumed. It is kept because step 3 and step 4 give the
