Lemma Solidity chunker

Turns Solidity into retrieval chunks via the compiler's AST, one chunk per
semantic unit, with natspec attached and citations that point at real bytes.

Input is a solc standard-json input file, the same `standard-input.json` that
verified deployments ship for Etherscan. That file carries the full source set
and the exact compiler settings used for the deployed bytecode, so chunks
describe that compiled source rather than whatever the working tree happened to
contain when the tool ran.

    python3 solidity.py \\
        --input .../MyContract-0xabc.../standard-input.json \\
        --solc solc --include 'src/**' --out chunks.jsonl

Read INVARIANTS.md before trusting the output. A crash is visible, but a chunk
that cites the wrong source can still look verified.
