"""hexctl - deterministic, receipt-backed controller for the one-shot loop.

The model does the work; this script decides what comes next and refuses to
advance without a receipt. State lives in `.hexaemeron/state.json` beside an
append-only, hash-chained ledger (`.hexaemeron/ledger.jsonl`). Every mutating
command appends a ledger entry, so `verify` can prove the run history was not
edited after the fact.

Phase order is fixed. Globally: study -> runbook -> steps -> integrate -> done.
Within each step: implement -> audit -> prose -> push. Step branches chain off
one another and their pull requests stack; nothing merges while the steps run.
The integrate phase merges the stack into the run branch in step order, then
merges the run branch into the recorded base exactly once and closes any
recorded task issue.

A run called against an issue is gated on what that issue filed. `init` reads
the issue's `Fiat-Required` line over REST and refuses to create any state,
worktree or branch when it says 0, because that filing decided the work is one
independent pull request rather than a run. The same read requires the issue's
`carryover` block, and `done integrate` requires it of the run's own pull
request body, so an outstanding item is either filed as its own issue, pointed
at the issue that already carries it, or refused with a stated reason.
`issue-check` runs that contract over a candidate body before anything is filed.

Exit codes: 0 success, 2 validation/usage error, 1 unexpected failure.
`issue-check` exits 1 on findings, which is a report rather than a crash.
Stdout from `next` and `status --json` is a single JSON object; everything
human-facing goes to plain text or stderr.
