"""Kronos ranking scoreboard.

Kronos scores every eligible held Fiat job out of 100, prints the result, runs
the winner, and then reranks from scratch. Nothing carries between passes, so a
job can score 62 in one pass and 78 three passes later with nothing about it
changed. This appends each pass to a file so that movement is visible.

  record  read a pass on stdin, validate it, append exactly one JSON line
  show    print the recorded passes and mark every axis score that moved for a
          candidate whose held job did not
  pull    copy the working copy from refs/heads/kronos/state
  push    fast-forward that ref from the working copy

  K000  a path that cannot be read
  K001  stdin that is not a JSON object
  K002  a required field that is missing
  K003  a field the record does not carry
  K004  an axis outside its range
  K005  a stated total that disagrees with the axes
  K006  a selection that is not what the tie-break picks
  K007  a candidate ledger that cannot be used
  K008  an existing scoreboard line that cannot be read
  K009  more candidates than the check will track
  K010  a scoreboard directory that is not a real directory
  K011  a halt reason that is empty or over the cap
  K012  a park for a skill that is already parked
  K013  an unpark with no standing park to release
  K014  a parked flag that disagrees with the standing parks
  K015  a pass in which every candidate is parked
  K016  a rank-only pass that names a Fiat run
  K017  an ungoverned list that is too long or holds something that is not a name
  K018  an existing state ref that cannot be read
  K019  a state-ref push that is not a fast-forward
  K020  a remote that is a URL or not a configured name
  K021  git could not start, timed out, or exceeded the output cap

Exit 0 clean, 1 a refusal, 2 bad invocation, and 3 from `parked` alone while a
park stands. That last is not an error in the tool. It is the loop's reason not
to declare itself finished, which is why it needs a code of its own rather than
the one argparse already spends on a bad invocation. A refusal appends nothing:
a pass, a park and an unpark are each recorded whole or not at all.

The held-job identity hash is not supplied by the caller. It is computed here
from the candidate's ledger, as the SHA-256 of the canonical frontier line that
VERSIONING.md already defines, which is the same digest each ledger stores in
its own history row. A line written here can therefore be checked against the
ledger it describes.

What this does not do. It records a judgement; it does not make one. An axis
score is a number the ranking agent supplies, and a basis is prose nobody
parses. It also cannot tell that a pass went unrecorded, because a loop that
skips this writer leaves a shorter file and nothing else.

The trust boundary is stdin, the argument list, and, for pull and push only, a
git subprocess. Ranking verbs start no subprocess and open no socket. The pass
document arrives from a caller and is read with a byte cap, an unknown field is
refused rather than stored, and the candidate count is capped. Each candidate
names a ledger path the caller chose, so that path is resolved, required to be a
regular file under the scoreboard's root, and read under a cap. An existing
scoreboard is validated line by line before anything is appended, so a run
interrupted mid-append is refused rather than written past.

pull and push copy the two JSONL files through a throwaway clone under the
system temp directory. Git is invoked with a fixed argv list, no shell, a
30-second timeout and a 2 MiB output cap. The remote is a configured remote
name, or KRONOS_STATE_REMOTE when that name is already configured; a URL
argument is refused. Git stderr is not copied into Kronos diagnostics. A
missing state ref is an empty start. An existing ref that cannot be read
refuses rather than clearing parks.
