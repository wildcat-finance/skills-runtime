"""Hypomnema record lint.

A record that points at something absent is worse than no record: it reads as
though the reason exists and was checked. This settles the part a parser can.

  H001  a relative link that resolves to nothing
  H002  a superseding pointer naming a record that does not exist
  H003  an alert naming a runbook file that is not there
  H004  a decision record missing one of the template's five sections
  H005  a decision record whose status is not dated
  H006  a source comment citing a record that does not exist
  H007  an alert runbook missing one of its three required answers

Exit 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 bad invocation.

Source files are walked beside the markdown: `#` comments in Python and
shell, `//` comments and `/* */` blocks in Solidity, JavaScript and
TypeScript. A marker counts only at the start of a line's stripped text
or preceded by whitespace, so a marker inside a string literal or a
URL's double slash earns no scan; that boundary is deliberate and a
reference the rule cannot see stays unchecked. References found in
comment text are resolved against the same index the markdown pass
builds from record file names. In source files the pragma is the bare
`hypomnema: allow <why>` after a comment marker, on the finding's line
or the one above it.

A decision record is a markdown file named `ADR-<number>...` inside a
directory named `decisions`. The shape codes hold it to the template the
SKILL states: a Status whose first line is a status word, a comma and an
ISO date, and the five sections Status, Context, Decision, Alternatives
and Consequences. Directory walks skip `fixtures` and `specimens`
directories relative to the walked root, because a specimen documenting a
fault is not a record and a preserved source carries its origin's links;
naming either path directly still reads it.

In Markdown, a `runbook:` keyword inside an inline code span is a quoted
specimen rather than a live pointer, so H003 passes over it. The keyword's
own position decides that: `runbook: ` followed by a backticked path is
still read and still resolved. Spans are paired per line, an unmatched
backtick run stays literal text, and a backtick escaped by an odd number of
backslashes opens nothing. A relative link inside a span is read the same
way, so H001 passes over it.

The Markdown keyword starts at the beginning of a line or after a character
other than a word character or hyphen. Word suffixes such as `myrunbook:` and
hyphenated tokens such as `sub-runbook:` are not pointers; list items and
dotted forms such as `annotations.runbook:` remain recognised.

An alert runbook is a Markdown file below a directory named `runbooks`.
It carries non-empty `## What fired`, `## First check` and `## Who to wake`
sections outside fenced examples. A reasoned pragma suppresses H007 only on
the file's first line or on the relevant heading.

Deliberate exceptions state a reason: `<!-- hypomnema: allow <why> -->`,
for a shape finding on the record's first line or the status heading.
