# The classifier refinement, the study

This run executes the reopened frontier's second job: the maintainer's
budgeted two-tier classifier, specified in writing at
`plugins/horos/docs/refinement/maintainer-spec.md` and committed verbatim
with the epoch. The specification is the requirement; this study maps it
onto the shipped scanner and names what each change costs.

## Assumptions

Proceeding on these unless corrected:

1. The specification's six changes are all in scope for this one run, and
   its pipeline diagram is the classification order: metadata checks, then
   the 4 KiB prefix, then two 2 KiB windows for large unresolved
   candidates, with hard evidence binding, weak evidence reported, and no
   evidence staying readable.
2. The boundary schema advances to 2: entries carry an evidence `grade`,
   only `hard` entries are written to `boundary.json` and bind agents, and
   `candidate` findings go to a sibling `candidates.json` plus the scan
   report. The maintainer's specification is the ask-first approval for
   the schema change. The recorded schema-1 captures stay immutable
   evidence; the third job recaptures everything under schema 2.
3. The hard grade is exactly the specification's list: exact lockfile
   name, a Git attribute, a binary file signature, a generated marker, and
   valid sourcemap structure. Directory names alone, filename conventions
   alone and geometry heuristics alone are candidates unless corroborated
   as the specification defines.
4. The tracked-files default introduces Horos's first subprocess:
   `git ls-files -z` with a fixed argument list, no shell, the scan root
   pinned as the working directory, and a filesystem-walk fallback when
   the root is not a git repository or git is absent. `--include-untracked`
   adds untracked-but-not-ignored files through the same plumbing.
5. The completed job increments evolution: `horos-v7.2.2` becomes
   `horos-v8.2.2`, generation and epoch retained, and the next held job is
   the three-repository boundary marking.

## 1. Problem statement

The shipped classifier trusts three things the specification correctly
distrusts: a directory name alone can exclude a whole subtree, only the
repository root's `.gitattributes` is consulted, and a 4 KiB prefix is the
only content evidence. The refinement makes the boundary safer (nothing
binds on a name or a shape alone) and more complete (nested attributes,
file signatures, second samples), while keeping the scan linear in file
count under a strict byte budget: most files metadata-only or 4 KiB, at
most 8 KiB for large unresolved candidates, attribute files capped at
64 KiB.

Restated as checkable conditions:

- A directory named `build` holding hand-written source is walked
  file-by-file, not excluded; the same name corroborated by markers, an
  attribute, package-manager structure or an overwhelming sample excludes
  as hard, with the corroboration quoted as evidence.
- A nested `.gitattributes` deep in the tree classifies its own directory's
  files exactly as a root one would, via a rule stack pushed and popped
  during the walk.
- A file over 64 KiB that the prefix cannot classify gets two more 2 KiB
  windows, middle and end; a marker or single-line geometry found there
  classifies it (geometry still only as candidate).
- The first bytes name PNG, JPEG, GIF, ZIP, PDF, WebAssembly, WOFF and
  other common signatures as hard binary evidence, replacing reliance on a
  null byte happening to appear.
- `boundary.json` (schema 2) holds hard entries only; `candidates.json`
  holds the rest with the same determinism rules; `check` verifies the
  hard set and, in this refinement, reports candidate drift without failing
  on it. That records the behaviour shipped here. Candidate classification or
  content drift itself remains advisory today, but a root check also binds raw
  canonical metadata: adding or removing a tracked candidate changes
  `files_walked` and can fail on that independent drift. Scoped checks remain
  entry-only.
- Scanning a git repository covers exactly `git ls-files` by default;
  `--include-untracked` widens it; a non-git tree walks the filesystem as
  before, and the boundary artefact records which mode produced it.

A working prototype means all of that pinned by tests, the shipped example
regenerated under schema 2 with a candidates artefact, and both suites and
lints green.

## 2. Prior art

The maintainer's specification is the design; this study adds no options to
it. The shipped scanner supplies the walk, the atomic writer and the
determinism rules. GitHub Linguist corroborates directory heuristics with
attributes the same way; `git ls-files` as the default universe is how most
linters bound themselves.

## 3. Constraints and non-goals

- Stdlib only; the one subprocess is git, fixed argv, no shell.
- map, census and the extractors do not change; census keeps counting the
  whole walked universe with hard-boundary attribution.
- Non-goals: recapturing the recorded bundles (the third job's work),
  repository-specific approved-candidate rules (the specification names
  them as a maintainer action, not a scanner feature), and any content
  sniffing beyond the budgeted windows.

## 4. Design options

The specification fixes the design, so the only options are sequencing.
**Chosen: independent signals first (attribute stack, signatures), then the
graded pipeline (corroboration, second windows, hard and candidate split,
schema 2), then the tracked-files universe.** Trade: three implementation
steps each touching `horos.py`, accepted because each lands green and the
graded pipeline is the only step that changes artefact shape.

## 5. Risk register seed

- The attribute stack must pop exactly when the walk leaves a directory;
  a stale rule misclassifies everything after it. Pinned with nested and
  sibling-directory cases.
- Corroboration sampling reads at most eight files at 4 KiB inside a
  candidate directory; the sample is the first eight sorted names, so it
  is deterministic by construction.
- The second-window reads must never lift the budget: two 2 KiB reads only
  for files over 64 KiB that the prefix left unclassified.
- Geometry found in a window stays a candidate; the grade comes from the
  evidence class, never from how hard it was to find.
- The git subprocess: fixed argv, `-z` for NUL-separated paths, no shell,
  cwd pinned to the scan root, output decoded with `errors="replace"`, and
  a clean fallback when git is absent or the root untracked. Phylax gets
  an allow comment naming exactly that.
- `check` under schema 2, as refined here: hard drift fails and candidate
  drift reports; both name paths. Under the current contract, candidate
  classification or content drift itself remains advisory, while root raw
  canonical metadata stays hard. Adding or removing a tracked candidate can
  therefore fail through `files_walked`; scoped checks remain entry-only.
- The adoption stanza stays true under schema 2 (the boundary lists only
  what binds); the SKILL.md discipline gains one line about candidates
  being advisory.

## 6. Glossary seeds

- Grade: `hard` or `candidate`; only hard binds.
- Corroboration: the second signal a directory name needs before it
  excludes as hard.
- Window: one of the two extra 2 KiB reads a large unresolved file gets.
- Universe: the file set a scan covers; tracked, tracked-plus-untracked,
  or the filesystem walk.

## 7. Boundaries

- **Always.** Both suites and the three tree lints before a commit;
  imprimatur on every shipped document; deterministic artefacts; the byte
  budget the specification states.
- **Ask first.** Any deviation from the specification's six changes; any
  further subprocess; changing the census's universe.
- **Never.** Let a candidate bind an agent; follow symlinks; run git with
  a shell; weaken the security-review exemption.

## 8. Success criteria

1. `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` passes.
2. `python3 -m unittest discover -s plugins/horos/tests -t plugins/horos`
   passes, including the new grade, attribute-stack, signature, window,
   corroboration and universe tests.
3. `python3 plugins/hexaemeron/skills/phylax/scripts/phylax.py plugins tests`
   and the ephoros equivalent exit clean.
4. Demo path: `python3 plugins/horos/skills/horos/scripts/horos.py scan
   plugins/horos/examples/fixture --json` reproduces the committed schema-2
   fixture boundary byte for byte, and the committed fixture
   `candidates.json` likewise.
