# goldfinch-demo-v0

<!-- marketplace-context:start -->
> **Marketplace context: Berean.** Berean pins the corpus, chain readings and evaluation record a protocol agent's answers rest on, so a release can be checked without the model that produced it. Use Lemma to produce source-linked chunks, Lazarus to preserve the chain evidence itself, and Ariadne to bind a released artefact digest to its evidence. **Current frontier:** The reference release answers against a frozen demonstration corpus and preserved Goldfinch mainnet reads; no release yet cites live Wildcat documentation or a captured Wildcat market read, and no Ariadne statement binds a berean release.
<!-- marketplace-context:end -->

The reference release. Its documents are written for the demonstration and
say so; its chain evidence is real.

## What it holds

`release/reads.jsonl` is a byte-for-byte copy of the Lazarus goldfinch-v0
preservation fixture's recorded RPC responses for the contract
`0x8bbd80f88e662e56b918c353da635e210ece93c6` at Ethereum mainnet block
13097494, and a plugin test holds the copy identical to its source
whenever both are in the tree. The records stay recorded-rpc evidence
here; nothing upgrades them, and the Lazarus release's own plan records
the block hash provenance.

The release under [`release/`](./release) carries three frozen corpus
documents, three pinned answers (one grounded, one refusal, one disclosing
a document-against-chain disagreement), an evaluation corpus of seven
cases covering all five adversarial classes, the graded report, and a
promotion chain with one earned record. Its retention declaration is
`none`, and the verifier holds the answers to that.

## Run it

From the repository root, no network needed:

```text
python3 plugins/berean/scripts/berean.py verify-release plugins/berean/examples/goldfinch-demo-v0/release
python3 plugins/berean/scripts/berean.py run-evals plugins/berean/examples/goldfinch-demo-v0/release
python3 plugins/berean/examples/goldfinch-demo-v0/demo.py
```

The demo verifies the gates, grades the corpus, replays the promotion
chain, then tampers with copies three ways and shows each named gate
refuse.

## Rebuild it

[`rebuild.py`](./rebuild.py) regenerates everything under `release/`
except the preserved `reads.jsonl` from the texts it carries,
deterministically; a test compares its output to the committed bytes. The
corpus files carry no rolling marketplace prose on purpose: their bytes
are pinned by the corpus manifest, and prose that moves under a frontier
refresh cannot live inside a digest.
