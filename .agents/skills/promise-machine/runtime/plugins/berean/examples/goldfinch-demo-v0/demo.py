"""Walk the goldfinch-demo-v0 release end to end, offline.

Five stages, each printing its named result: verify the release's gates,
grade its evaluation corpus, replay the promotion chain, then prove the
pins bite by tampering copies three ways and watching each named gate
refuse. Exit 0 means every stage behaved; nothing here reaches a network.
