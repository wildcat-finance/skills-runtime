"""Every venue probitas knows about, whether or not it can check it.

The registry is where gate 2 lives. A venue with no adapter is not absent from
the dossier; it is a row in the coverage table saying nobody checked. Silence
about a venue reads as a clean record, and a clean record is the most expensive
thing this tool could get wrong.

`implemented` states whether an adapter ships today, not whether one is
planned. A test asserts the flags match the adapters that
are actually registered, so the registry cannot drift into claiming coverage
the tool does not have.
