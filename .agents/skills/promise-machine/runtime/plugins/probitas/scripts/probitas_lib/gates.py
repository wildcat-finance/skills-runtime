"""The five gates, run over a dossier and its evidence together.

This is the half that matters. The model writes the narrative and this runs
afterwards, because a model asked to cite its sources produces citation-shaped
sentences at some rate above zero and nothing inside the model catches them.

Gate 3 is the interesting one. It does not merely check that evidence records
carry sources, which the schema already guarantees. It recomputes, from the
evidence alone, every number and hash a truthful dossier could contain, then
fails the document on any it contains that is not in that set. A model that
invents a transaction hash, rounds an amount, or adds a plausible extra market
gets caught by arithmetic rather than by reading.
