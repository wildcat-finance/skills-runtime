"""The evidence file: the dossier's only permitted source of fact.

A record cannot exist without a source. That is enforced here, at
construction, rather than checked later, because a claim that can be
represented without a citation is a claim that will eventually ship without
one.

Amounts stay strings on the wire. Subgraphs return token amounts as decimal
strings of arbitrary size, and Python integers are unbounded, so the danger is
not overflow but a `float` somewhere quietly rounding a balance.
