# Venue coverage

<!-- marketplace-context:start -->
> **Marketplace context: Probitas.** Probitas builds a sourced record of what a counterparty did across lending venues from addresses they declared, without identifying a person or issuing a Wildcat verdict. Use Alexandria for archived lending inputs and Tabularium when the job is publishing a reusable credit-event release rather than assessing one counterparty. **Current frontier:** Morpho Midnight fixed-maturity coverage now ships API-scoped on Base; secondary-market borrow exits stay refused as unattributable and Morpho curation remains uncollected.
<!-- marketplace-context:end -->

Fifteen venues in the registry, five of them with adapters. The other ten
still get a row in every dossier, saying plainly that nobody checked. That is
gate 2 doing its job.

[Adding a venue](../../../docs/adding-a-venue.md) covers what each gap is and
what closing one takes. This file is the short form.

Run `python3 scripts/probitas.py venues` for the current state; this file
explains why it looks the way it does.

## What ships

| Venue | Source | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wildcat | Public Goldsky subgraph, Ethereum mainnet | none |
| Morpho Blue | `blue-api.morpho.org/graphql`, Ethereum mainnet | none |
| Euler v1 | Canonical proxy log through `mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co` | none |
| Euler v2 | `v3.euler.finance`, Ethereum mainnet event ledger | none |
| Morpho Midnight | `api.morpho.org/v0/midnight`, Base fixed-maturity markets | none |

All five adapters name their chain in the coverage note. Wildcat is deployed on
Plasma as well and Morpho on several chains, and a row that says only `checked`
would let a reader take one chain's silence for all of them.

These four are the adapter route. Goldfinch and Clearpool are reachable through
the archive route instead, from verified Alexandria releases, and one `collect`
run can ask for both: `--fixtures DIR` or `--live` backs the adapter route and
`--alexandria-index X` adds the archive one. Every coverage row names which
route produced it, so a venue read from a preserved release never reads as one
an adapter queried today. An index passed on its own still suppresses the
adapter route and reaches no network.

## What does not, and why

| Venue | Blocker |
| --- | --- |
| MetaMorpho vaults | Same keyless API as Morpho Blue, not collected. A counterparty may appear here as a curator rather than a borrower |
| Morpho Vaults V2 | Same, a separate surface with its own allocation transactions |
| Centrifuge | Keyless GraphQL at `api.centrifuge.io`, introspects cleanly, 24 mainnet pools. Needs only an adapter |
| Aave v3 | Keyless at `api.aave.com/graphql`, carrying `userBorrows` and `userPositions`. Introspection is off but errors name fields |
| Aave v4 | Live on Ethereum mainnet since March 2026, same first-party API. A v3 borrower and a v4 borrower are one counterparty |
| Maple Finance | Answers but disables introspection and publishes no schema, so the query shape cannot be established without guessing |
| Compound v3 | No first-party API answered; The Graph gateway needs a paid key |
| Goldfinch | Wound down June 2026 after defaults. Needs a gateway key. The record is a list of who did not repay, which is worth more than most live venues |
| Clearpool | Live, behind a bot challenge returning 403. An agreement is the way in, not a workaround |
| TrueFi | Restructured through a token migration completing May 2026; no public endpoint answered |

Five of the ten need only an adapter. The rest are blocked on somebody else's
key, bot protection or documentation.

## The five venues read differently, and the dossier says so

**Wildcat is undercollateralised.** Nothing stood between the lender and a loss
except the borrower, so a missed reserve ratio is about conduct. This is the
only venue where a borrower chose their own terms and can be measured against
them.

**Morpho Blue is overcollateralised.** The collateral answered the question and
nobody was relying on the borrower's word, so a liquidation says a price moved
and the protocol closed a position. Reporting one as a default would be the
wrong claim about a named company. Bad debt is the exception, and it gets a record of
its own: a liquidation that failed to cover the debt is a loss somebody else
absorbed.

**Euler v1 is overcollateralised and proxy-scoped.** The adapter reads exact
borrow, repayment and liquidation amounts from the canonical mainnet proxy
log. It filters by the indexed borrower, checks every event block hash before
using its timestamp, and reports the finalized RPC boundary.

**Euler v2 is overcollateralised and EVC-scoped.** The adapter reads borrow,
repayment and liquidation events from the V3 ledger, files them under the EVC
owner and retains the touched subaccount. Interest accrual is omitted because
it is not a new draw. Liquidations retain debt and collateral decimals and are
not called defaults.

**Morpho Midnight is fixed-maturity**, and it now ships. A maturity is a date
by which the money was due, so it is the only venue outside Wildcat where
repayment timeliness has an answer rather than a story about a price. Coverage
is Base chain id 8453 through the keyless REST API alone: every cursor page is
exhausted once, and the coverage row states the observation time and the
returned index bound. The API's history lower bound is unpublished, so this is
API-scoped history rather than archive-chain completeness. An incomplete,
ambiguous or out-of-bounds response returns no records and a named gap instead
of a partial answer, and a secondary-market borrow exit is refused outright
because its account-attributed debt units are unproved. Obligation state and
settlement conduct stay apart: an overdue maturity closed by liquidation reads
as settled late through liquidation, never as voluntary repayment, and a zero
balance now cannot rewrite an outstanding-at-maturity verdict.

## Wildcat, in detail

What the adapter emits, one record per event, each citing its own transaction:

| Claim | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| `market_terms` | The reserve ratio, rate, grace period and penalty rate the borrower set |
| `market_standing` | Drawn, repaid, penalty interest accrued, and whether the market is delinquent now |
| `borrow`, `repayment` | Each draw and each repayment |
| `delinquency_entered` | Liquidity fell below the reserve ratio, with what was held against what was required |
| `delinquency_cured` | It came back, how long it took, and whether that ran past the grace period |
| `withdrawal_batch_expired_unpaid` | A lender asked for money and did not get it |
| `market_closed` | The borrower closed the market |

Two readings this adapter gets right and a naive one does not.

`timeDelinquent` is signed and runs negative while a market is healthy. It is
negative on live mainnet markets right now. Read as a duration it invents a
delinquency out of a clean record, so `isDelinquent` is the flag that decides.

A cured delinquency is not a default. A borrower who went short and came back
inside the grace period paid no penalty interest, and the dossier says so, with
the span and the verdict. That distinction is the one a hand-assembled writeup
usually loses, and one of the synthetic fixtures exists to hold it still.

## Morpho Blue, in detail

| Claim | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| `borrow`, `repayment` | Each draw and each repayment against a Blue market |
| `liquidation` | The position was closed. The record states it was collateralised, so nobody reads it as a default |
| `bad_debt` | The liquidation did not cover the debt. Lenders lost money |

Repaid and seized are different assets with different decimals, so they carry
their own scales: `token_decimals` for the loan and `collateral_decimals` for
what was taken. One scale for both is a figure wrong by orders of magnitude.

The supply side is ignored on purpose, and the ignored types are listed rather
than assumed. Lending money says nothing about whether someone repays what they
take, but a type in neither table means the venue changed its vocabulary, and
that raises rather than dropping records in silence.

## Coverage over the whole chain

The Wildcat block range starts at the arch controller deployment, block
18686645 on mainnet. The Morpho range starts at 18919623, the earliest market
creation across all 1,727 mainnet markets, taken by paging the API rather than
by trusting an announcement. Before those blocks there was nothing on either
venue to have a history in, so they are the honest lower bounds.

Euler v1 queries the canonical proxy from block 0 through a finalized block.
Euler v2 reports its own complete indexed range on every activity response. The
adapter refuses partial, syncing or category-incomplete coverage and records
the common mainnet range across all requested EVC owners.
