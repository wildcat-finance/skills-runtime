"""The dataset predicate: a released set of data files, and what it leaves out.

Its subject is a released file rather than compiled bytecode. What it adds to the
core block is the part that makes a dataset release checkable rather than merely
published: which inputs it was derived from, which tool turned them into the
released files, what interval it claims to describe, and where inside that
interval it describes nothing.

Two gates belong here, as they do for any predicate. Gate 2 holds that the
environment is recoverable, which is why a tool name and a version on their own
fail: without the parameters and the input digests nobody produces the same
files. Gate 5 holds that a comparison names both sides, so a delta against a
release that cannot be identified fails rather than quietly reporting no change.

Two further checks are this predicate's own, in the same sense that `audits` and
`deployments` belong to the Solidity release predicate. The coverage check is
gate 3's rule applied to the field a dataset can most easily use to mislead: an
interval printed with no gaps reads as complete. The inputs check refuses an
input that carries neither a digest nor a recorded reason for not having one,
because a locator on its own records nothing about what was read.

Coverage bounds are integers. Block heights are integers, timestamps are not
necessarily, and comparing across the two representations is how an interval
check comes to pass on values it never really ordered. A producer with
timestamps records them as integers or uses a different dimension.
