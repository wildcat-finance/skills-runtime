"""Verification: the core gates, the signature state, and what went unchecked.

A report says three things. Whether each gate that ran held. What is known
about the signatures, which is never that they were checked, because this tool
does not check them. And which predicate-owned gates did not run, whether the
type is unknown or a registered module is incomplete, so a reader is told what
was not looked at rather than left to assume it was clean.
