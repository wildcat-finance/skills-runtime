# The dataset predicate

<!-- marketplace-context:start -->
> **Marketplace context: Ariadne.** Ariadne binds an artefact digest to the build, test, review and deployment evidence behind a release. Use an external Sigstore or cosign verifier for signature identity; use Lazarus for historical fixtures and Pandects for executable credit-law evidence. **Current frontier:** The grounded-agent predicate now ships as the fifth registered Ariadne predicate, with a closed schema, gates 2 and 5, conformance fixtures and a bounded offline capture path that binds an existing `berean-release/v1` tree without importing or running Berean, executing an agent, regrading evaluations or reaching a network.

Type URI: `https://ariadne.wildcat.finance/dataset/v1`.

Its subject is a released set of data files. What it adds to the core block is
the part that makes a dataset release checkable rather than merely published:
which inputs it was derived from, which tool turned them into the released
files, what interval it claims to describe, and where inside that interval it
describes nothing.

This document states the shape. The gates are enforced in
`scripts/ariadne_lib/predicates/dataset.py`, the published shape is
`schemas/dataset-v1.json`, and the two are held together by
`tests/test_schema_drift.py`.

## The fields

| Field | Holds | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `producer` | The tool, its version, the argv that ran, and a digest over its parameters | gate 2 |
| `inputs` | Each upstream input: name, locator, and either a digest or a recorded absence | gate 2, inputs check |
| `dataset_subjects` | Each released file: name, path, digest, record count | gate 2 |
| `coverage` | The dimension, its bounds, and the gaps inside them | coverage check |
| `deltas` | Baseline and current sides, and the record-level differences | gate 5 |
| `claims` | What was checked, against which subject digest | gates 1 and 3 |
| `commands` | What was run, and whether a replay must match byte for byte | gates 3 and 6 |

Every field is required. There is no optional block: a release derived from
nothing upstream records an empty `inputs` array, which says the question was
asked and answered.

## Gate 2 here: the environment is recoverable

Recoverable means somebody else can produce the same files. That takes the
producing tool and its version, the argv that ran, a digest over the parameters
it was given, and a digest or a recorded absence for every input. Each
`dataset_subjects` digest must also be a subject of the statement, so the
predicate cannot describe files the statement does not cover.

A tool name and a version on their own fail, for the same reason a bare compiler
version fails in the Solidity release predicate: without the parameters nobody
gets the same bytes back.

Each released file's `path` is release-relative, not absolute and carrying no `..`
segment, because a reader resolves it against the release directory and either form
would send them somewhere else. No two entries may name the same path: one file
cannot carry two digests, and the release digest is taken over this listing.
`record_count` is a whole number and never negative.

## Gate 5 here: a comparison names both sides

The baseline is a named prior release with a digest, or `null` with a reason. A
first release carries the null and the reason rather than leaving the block out,
because an absent `deltas` block reads as nothing having changed instead of as
there being nothing to change from.

Record-level differences recorded against a null baseline fail. There was no
prior release to differ from. The current side is checked either way: a first
release still has to name it and digest it, and that digest still has to be a
subject of the statement.

A release compared against itself fails. `records` carries `added`, `removed` and
`changed` and nothing else, because an unknown key inside a digested comparison is
undeclared content just as an unknown section is.

## The coverage check

Not one of the seven. It is gate 3's rule applied to the field a dataset can
most easily use to mislead: an interval printed with no gaps reads as complete.

- `dimension` and both bounds are required.
- `start` must not exceed `end`.
- Every gap must sit inside the bounds, and must carry a reason.
- Gaps must not overlap each other.
- An absent `gaps` key fails. An empty array passes, and asserts that the
  producer looked.
- A reason of whitespace is no reason, the same way gate 3 treats a whitespace
  claim reason.
- `dimension` has to name something.

## The inputs check

An input carries a digest, or a disposition describing an absence with a reason.
An input with neither fails: a locator on its own records nothing about what was
read, and nothing about whether it could be read at all.

`passed` is not available as a disposition here. An input that was read has a
digest, so `passed` without one was a single word that got around this check
entirely, asserting the input was read while recording nothing about it. The
dispositions this field accepts are `failed`, `skipped`, `timed_out` and
`redacted`, and each needs a reason.

## What this predicate does not do

Nothing here reaches a network. An input that cannot be digested from disk is
recorded absent with a reason rather than fetched. Nothing signs, and nothing
reports a signature as checked.
